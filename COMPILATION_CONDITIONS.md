# Compilation Conditions

Our code uses several (custom) [compilation conditions](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/11.4/#/itcaec37c2a6) (search for `SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS`).

| Compilation Condition | Description |
|---|---|
| `DEBUG` | Development/Debug builds should be considered the opposite of `RELEASE`. Code wrapped in `DEBUG` is assumed to work only on non-production environments such as unit- or ui-testing. |
| `RELEASE` | `true` if the app was built in release-mode. We mainly use this flag to disable certain features (developer menu, logging, â€¦) for production. If you want to disable a certain feature for production you should use `#if !RELEASE` as opposed to `#if DEBUG`. |
| `COMMUNITY` | `true` is the *Community* build configuration/schema has been selected. The *Community* configuration enables other developers to run the app in Simulator. |
| `USE_DEV_PK_FOR_SIG_VERIFICATION` | `true` if the app should use the dev-public keys for the signature verfification. This is only set for testing and during development. In case this is set mistakenly to `true` the app simply stops working. |
| `DISABLE_CERTIFICATE_PINNING` | `true` if certificate pinning should be disabled. This is **NEVER EVER** set for builds that will end up in the App Store. We only use this for debugging purposes. |


# UI testing

The previously existing `UITESTING` flag has been removed in favor of an environment variable `XCUI` with value `YES`. A convenience property `isUITesting` has been set up.
To prevent possible 'leaks' of test code into production releases it is recommended to wrap all usage into `DEBUG` flags. Example:

```
#if DEBUG
  if isUITesting {
    // UI test code
  }
#endif
```
