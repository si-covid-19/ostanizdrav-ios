#  Backend Code

This directory contains code generated by [swift-protobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf). The code can be re-generated by executing the following command from the root of your working copy:

``` shell
$ ./proto/convert_proto_to_swift.sh
```

This will read all `*.proto`–files in `$root/proto/resources` to `*.pb.swift`–files and write them to `$root/src/xcode/gen/output`. Those files are then referenced from a group called *ENA | Backend* within our Xcode project.

Those files expose classes that de- and encode data that conforms to the corresponding Protocol Buffer schema.
