Your iPhone, in turn, receives the random IDs of the other smartphones. Your own random IDs and those received from other smartphones are recorded in the exposure log and stored there for 14 days.\n\n\nTo identify your risk of infection, the App loads a list – once a day – of the random IDs of all users who have told the App that they have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. This list is then compared with the random IDs stored in the exposure log. If the App detects that you may have been in contact with an infected user, it will inform you of this and tell you that there is a risk that you are also infected. In this case, the App is also given access to other data stored in your iPhone’s exposure log (date, duration and Bluetooth signal strength of the contact).\n\nThe Bluetooth signal strength is used to derive the physical distance (the stronger the signal, the smaller the distance). The App then analyses this information in order to assess your likelihood of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and to give you recommendations for what to do next. This analysis is only performed locally on your iPhone. Apart from you, nobody will know whether you have been in contact with an infected person and what risk has been identified for you.\n\nTo withdraw your consent to the exposure logging feature, you can disable the feature using the toggle switch in the App or delete the App. If you decide to use the exposure logging feature again, you can toggle the feature back on or reinstall the App. If you disable the exposure logging feature, the App will no longer check whether you have been in contact with an infected user. If you also wish to stop your device sending and receiving random IDs, you will need to disable COVID-19 Exposure Logging in your iPhone settings. Please note that your own random IDs and those received from other smartphones which are stored in the exposure log will not be deleted in the App. You can only permanently delete the data stored in the exposure log in your iPhone settings.\n\n\nThe App’s privacy notice (including an explanation of the data processing carried out for the exposure logging feature) can be found in the menu under “Data Privacy Information”.";
