This information will be used to assess the risk of infection for app users with whom you have come into contact, and to warn them if there is a risk that they are infected. In order to be able to warn the users of official coronavirus apps in other participating countries, the app’s server system will also make this information available to the joint exchange server operated by the participating countries.\n\nNeither other users nor the NIJZ or the health authorities of participating countries can infer your identity, name or other personal information from the data transmitted.\n\nTransmitting your random IDs and any information about the onset of your symptoms for transnational alerts is voluntary. You will not be penalised if you do not share this information. Since it is not possible to trace or check whether and how you use the app, nobody but you will know whether you provide your random IDs.\n\nYou can withdraw your consent at any time by deleting the app. This withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent prior to the withdrawal.\n\nFurther information – including about the participating countries and their health authorities responsible for data protection matters – can be found in the menu under “App Information” > “Data Privacy”.";

You just need to make sure that the exposure logging feature is still enabled. Exposure logging will automatically warn you about any possible exposure involving another user of the #OstaniZdrav App or any other official coronavirus app.\n\nIf you have enabled the “Exposure Notifications” functionality on your iPhone, then your iPhone continuously generates random IDs and sends them via Bluetooth so that they can be received by other smartphones near you. Your iPhone, in turn, receives the random IDs of other smartphones. Your own random IDs and those received from other smartphones are recorded by your iPhone and stored there for 14 days.\n\nFor exposure logging, the app downloads up-to-date lists every day of the random IDs of all users who have shared their test result (more precisely: their own random IDs) via their official coronavirus app in order to warn other users. These lists are then compared with the random IDs of other users which have been recorded by your iPhone. The app will inform you if it detects a possible exposure. In this case, the app gains access to the data recorded by your iPhone about the possible exposure (date, duration and Bluetooth signal strength of the contact). The Bluetooth signal strength is used to derive the physical distance to the other user (the stronger the signal, the smaller the distance). The app analyses this information in order to calculate your risk of infection and to give you recommendations for what to do next. This analysis is only performed locally on your iPhone.\n\nThe app’s privacy notice (including information about the data processing carried out for the transnational exposure logging feature) can be found in the menu under “App Information” > “Data Privacy”.";
