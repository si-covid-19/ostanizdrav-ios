#  Developer Menu

This directory contains code used by the app if it is built either in `RELEASE` or `DEBUG`. If the currently active build configuration is set to `APP_STORE` then the code will not be executed.

The *developer menu*-related code is used to create a menu within the app that makes debugging and testing more convenient.
